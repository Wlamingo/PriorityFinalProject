The app allows you to create tasks and filter them based on whether or not they should be prioritized and also allows you to search for tasks based on their name.
Link(s) to any other public GitHub repo(s) of your app. If you have one repo for iOS / Android and one for Backend, please link to your backend repo in your iOS / Android README, and your iOS / Android repo in your backend README.

A short description of your app (its purpose and features)
<br>
The app is meant to enable users to more easily keep track of their tasks. The primary features are the add task button and the search tab at the top of the app.
<br>
A list of how your app addresses each of the requirements
<br>
The navigation controller is used to navigate to the description page for each task as well as to add a new task. 
The main view controller has a UITableView for the tasks that the user has added.
We used both SnapKit and NSLayoutConstraint in different parts of the app. 
The API we used stores the tasks that the user has made. The data we have in the API can also be brought to the app.
<br>Anything else you want your grader to know
Note: The link, screenshots, and description will be used for the Hack Challenge website where we will showcase everyone’s final projects
<br> We were not able to fully implement the "make priority" button.
